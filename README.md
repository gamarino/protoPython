# protoPython

A high-performance Python 3.14 compatible environment built on top of [protoCore](../protoCore/).

## Community & Open Review

Beyond formal audits, this project is officially **open for Community Review and Suggestions**.

We welcome architectural feedback, edge-case identification, and performance critiques. While the core vision is firm, the path to perfection is a collective effort of the "Swarm."

## Project Overview

ProtoPython aims to provide a GIL-less, highly parallel Python runtime and a C++ compiler for Python modules.

### Components

- **protoPython Library**: The core runtime library defining the Python environment over `ProtoSpace`.
- **protopy**: A GIL-less Python 3.14 compatible runtime.
- **protopyc**: A compiler that translates Python modules into C++ shared libraries based on `protoCore`.

## The Swarm of One

**The Swarm of One** is the transition from "Individual Contributor" to "System Architect": a single human architect orchestrating a swarm of specialized AI agents to tackle high-density infrastructure that previously required entire R&D departments.

In protoPython, that meant going from infrastructure to a runtime—and a **unified memory bridge (UMD)** across language paradigms—in record time. The same protoCore cells that back JavaScript and C++ now back Python; the execution engine, type bridges, and module resolution were designed and implemented with AI as a force multiplier. The result is the democratization of high-level engineering: one architect, one vision, amplified.

## The Methodology: AI-Augmented Engineering

This project was built using **extensive AI-augmentation tools** to empower human vision and strategic design.

This is not "AI-generated code" in the traditional sense; it is **AI-amplified architecture**. The vision, the constraints, and the trade-offs are human; the execution is accelerated by AI as a force multiplier for complex system design. We don't just use AI—we embrace it as the unavoidable present of software engineering.
